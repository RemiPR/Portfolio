I also collaborated with two classmates to create a 3D Tetris game using Unity.\n\nSecond Year:\nI collaborated with two classmates to create a job posting website using the MERN technology stack. This project was written up as a scientific article and presented at the KVK technology conference. My second-year coursework included a project where I first used the Nuxt framework with Tailwind CSS and Node.js for the backend to create an achievement evaluation system web application. Another major project was a mobile application developed with Android Studio for a client in Vilnius. Working in a team of five students, we created an app to help users choose a smart home system. I was responsible for the Scrum master role, design, and frontend development.\n\nThird Year:\nInformation is being updated.",
